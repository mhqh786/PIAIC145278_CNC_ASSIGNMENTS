    Cloud Native Computing:
</p>
<div class="c">
    The <b>Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the student to program in open source 
    technologies like, <b>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.s, React and React Native</b> 
    while introducing the students to development of Microservies and software development
    techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
